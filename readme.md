The repo features support for Pug, Sass, and JavaScript compilers, making it easy to preprocess your code. The repository also includes built-in support for minification of CSS and JavaScript files, as well as code maps, to help you debug your code. 

dditionally, Webpack 5 includes image processing capabilities, allowing you to optimize and compress images for faster page loading times.
